Security
For the most part (and where not otherwise explicit) turboSMTP’s API requires Authorization.

Authorization to access a user’s resource is granted to clients provided they set authentication headers into their request, valued with the proper values issued by turboSMTP servers.

* Authorization via ConsumerKey/ConsumerSecret
This type of authorization consists of a pair of headers, named consumerKey and consumerSecret that are created and granted to the end user to be used in a permanent way (unless they´re deleted of course). This kind of authentication is intended to provide access to endpoints features without the need of providing the user the account details (email address + password).

consumerKey: Consumer Key Granted.

consumerSecret: Consumer Secret Granted.

(Use /consumerKeys/create create a consumer key/secret pair).

* Authorization via Authentication Key
The authentication key is user-based and it is issued by turboSMTP servers upon successful user’s email address + password challenge, performed by means of appropriate request.

Authorization: Authorization_Key

(Use /authentication/authorize to obtain an API Key)

Data Interchange Format
For the most part (and where not otherwise explicit) turboSMTP’s API uses JSON as the data format of choice when it comes to request and response bodies.
